      <description>The Challenge I decided to try the challenge on AWS, since most of the jobs I could find require some knowledge of it. Maybe I can try Azure or GCP in the future for other projects, but AWS&amp;rsquo;s free tier helped a lot with this decision. Certification
I don&amp;rsquo;t have the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, but this was an amazing way to study for this certification, and I am for sure giving it a try after this.</description>
